Save relative URLs to database. Present absolute URLs for viewing.

== Description ==

When inserting images or links in content Wordpress saves them as absolute URLs. This plugin removes the get_bloginfo('url') portion as content is saved and inserts it again when content is viewed.

This helps when you want to copy or move a site for any reason, essentially any time you want to present content from a domain other than the one it which it was created. At the same time it supports SEO requirements for absolute URLs, which appear to be at the heart of all arguments for absolute URLs.

== Installation ==

1. In WordPress go to Plugins->Add New and locate the plugin (e.g. search ‘absolute relative url’
1. Click the install button
1. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu

Alternatively you can download the plugin from www.oxfordframework.com/absolute-relative-urls, upload it through the Wordpress plugin uploader, and activate through the Plugins menu.

That's it! Check your database after you've saved some content. URLs should be root relative. Check your editor. URLs should be absolute. Check the source on your web page. URLs should be absolute.

The plugin does not retroactively modify urls in your database unless you manually update content.

Should you stop using the plugin your website will still work as the plugin uses root relative urls and browsers assume the same domain when they see a relative url. Exceptions would be when a you are running in a subdirectory and that is part of your site url, or if you are providing an RSS feed to third parties where absolute urls are required.

* New in version 1.5.4

Allow urls from related sites to be saved as relative urls. This makes it easier to copy/paste html content from one site to another (e.g. staging to production, production to development). Note that this doesn't solve all problems with copy/paste from one site to another. For example, if images on one site are in a different folder, they will still need to be tweaked manually.

To add related sites, add a filter and function to your functions.php similar to the following:

	// add related sites to be saved as relative urls
	add_filter( 'of_absolute_relative_urls_related_sites', 'my_related_sites' );
	function my_related_sites( $related_sites ) {
		$related_sites[] = [
			'wpurl' => 'https://www.chennabaree.com', // wp url
			'url' => 'https://www.chennabaree.com' // site url
		];
		$related_sites[] = [
			'wpurl' => 'https://www.schoolofunusualarts.com'
		];
		return $related_sites;
	}

Note: if site url and wp url are identical, you only need to specify 'wpurl'.
 
* New in version 1.5.0, 1.5.1

Enable all options instead of specific options. In functions.php, put
    add_filter( 'of_absolute_relative_urls_enable_all', function() { return true; } );

Manage filters that get processed by modifying the array of filters. Build a function to add or remove filter names in the array. Then in functions.php, put
    add_filter( 'of_absolute_relative_urls_{type}_filters', 'your_function' );
where {type} is 'view', 'save', 'option' or 'exclude_option'.
